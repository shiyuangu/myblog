#+TITLE: Cooking: My Scientific Approach
If we google a particular dish, we usually find many different receipts. I find all receipts do something right 
(sometimes, something wrong too). I try to learn from each receipt, combine the right practice and also understand 
the science behind.  This blog is to document my success, my failure and my thinking.

** First Attempt:
What I did: 
+ Two eggs + two tomatoes 
+ whisk the eggs
+ add 1 tbsp butter to pan, preheat until butter begins to sizzle. 
+ pour the whisked eggs, let it set for 3-4 minutes, heat level on 6. 
  Turn it around, scramble, then remove to a plate. 
+ Put the tomatoes, high heat, squeeze/press the tomato 
  until the tomatoes becomes (puree)
+ add back the eggs, mix well the tomato and immediately remove to a plate.
  Eggs are delicate and will continue to 
Afterthoughts:
eggs are not fluffy enough. Possible causes: 
+ [[http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/scrambled-eggs-with-tomato-cheddar-and-basil.html][Williams-sonoma.com]] , we should add water to eggs which chinese cooking guide says it is a bad idea.
+ not enough egg and eggs span too thin on the pan. 
+ not whisked enough. 
+ the eggs are overcook. Maybe 1 minute is enough. 

** Second Attempt:
+ Three eggs + half cup water + two tomatoes(with wrinkles and seems about to 
  go bad). 
+ mix water and eggs and whisk until fully fluffy
+ turn the stove to heat level 6, add tbsp buffer to pan, preheat until butter begin to sizzle. 
+ pour the whisked eggs. This time it is too fluffy and the water in the egg
  evaporates and the egg mixture explored too much and I have to stir, the 
  curd are too small. And I clearly a lot of hole in the curd which indicates
  too much water.
** Third Attempt:
+ 1 teaspoon water + two eggs + two tomatoes
+ This time, enough wihisk, but the eggs are not tender and juicy, two possible
causes: 1): Not enough water, next try 1/4 cup + two eggs. 2). overcook. 
this time is a little more than two minutes before turn. Next try 1 minutes and turn. 
** Fourth Attempt (Finally!): 
Ingredients: 
+ 2 eggs, 1 tomatoes(wrinkle ripe, important! I don't like sour. ), parsley, 1/4 cup of water, butter. 

Steps: 
+ In a large bowl, mix 1/4 cup of water and two eggs(the ratio of water and eggs is the most important step in this receipt). Whisk/beat crazily.  
+ Heat 1 tbsp butter on medium heat(level 5). Add butter. When the foaming subsides, pour in egg mixture. Let it cook (still on medium heat) for 2-3  minutes. Don't stir so that we can have large curbs. As the eggs begin to (set), gently (pull) the eggs across the skillet with an turner  Turn the curb almost immediately turn off the heat. We shall see the curb is still a bit (moist, Some directions suggest continue cooking, pulling and lifting until no egg liquid remains) . Move the curb to a plate. 
+ Put the pan back to medium heat, melt 2 tbsp butter(maybe we shall use more butter since the good () in tomatoes only disolves in oil). When the foaming subsides, add the sliced tomatos. Squezze and let it cook until the tomatoes becomes puree. No worry about overcook for tomatoes. The good stuff () is very stable. We want the tomatoes well cook so that the cell structure is destroyed and the () is released out. 
+ Add the curb, mix and immediate remove the pan from the heat. Add a pinch of parseley and serve. 

Afterthought: 
The egg curb are large enough, tender and juicy, right amount of sour. Smell good, looks good and taste good.  This is the idea result I am looking for. The curb is a bit too wet. Maybe cook it a few more second after the turnover. 

Afterthoughts: 
+ The egg is very tender and juicy and actually tastes good. This is probably
because the curd is more fluffy than the first attempt. Adding water might 
help produce more fluffy curd. Next try add less water but whisk harder to see
whether we can produce as fluffy curb as this time.  
+ tomatoes with wrinkles is less sour and is better for this dish. 

Fifth attempt: 
same as fourth attempt, but this time clearly too much water. Probably the eggs are small this time. Whisk is also harder this time. Next try, adjust the water based on the size of eggs, add less water and whisk as hard as we can. 
  
Six attempt: 
1/8 cup water : two eggs (0.24 lb) seems to be right ratio. Beat hard until the egg mixture is all bubbo and no liquid can be seen. 
* Honey baked Chicken Wing 
 I almost follow the instruction of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmlgqoUo0es][this video]] except 
that I brash with the honey at the very end and turn the oven to  
"broil" to make the skin crispy. This is a common-use of broil [fn:1]. 
This is what I did: 
+ Put the wings in a bowl, add dark soy sauce[fn:2], black pepper, salt. 
  Let the wings set for four hours (The video receipt suggests two hours).
+ preheat the oven to 380^oF, bake the wings on a baking rack for 30min, turn
  the wings around half way to bake evenly on both side. 
+ Mix 1 tbsp honey with 1/2 tbsp water, coat the wings, turn to oven to broil, 
  and broil the wings for 4-5 minutes. 
+ Cool and Serve. 

Afterthoughts:
+ The wings are crispy and the taste is just right. 
  The wings are a bit burnt 
  (which seems to be a common problem when baked with sugar. 
   All pictures online show the same problem). 
  Try reduce the broil time to 3 minutes next time. 
+ The wings was on the lower rack of the oven when broiled. 
  Cooking guides[2] suggest broiling is done close to the heat source 
  (2-5 inches from the flame(top burner). Try to place the honey-coated wings
  on the upper rack of the oven when broil next time. 
+ The step of turning around wing half way when baked may not be necessary.
  The whole idea of baking is to use the ambient hot air instead of 
  the infrared radiation. If an oven is designed properly, 
  turning the wings around half way may not be necessary. Try to cut this
  step next time.
  - Another experiment confirms this: no need to turn the wing around halfway. 
    When baked on a rack, both side are evenly cooked.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/tools-and-techniques/question228.htm

[fn:2] There are two types of soy source used in Asian cooking:  light soy sauce and 
       dark soy sauce.  Dark soy sauce is thicker, easier to stick to the material and 
       hence a better choice for baking. Dark soy source also adds nice color to a dish. According to 
       [[http://chinesefood.about.com/od/chinesefoodglossary1/g/dark-soy-sauce.htm][this]], dark soy source may contain up to 10 times anti-oxidants found in red wine, and
       has the health benefits of improving blood flow. However, dark soy sauce has a high sodium content. 
       As far as I know, study shows correlations between high sodium intake and high blood pressure. You might
       feel confused: Then is it dark soy sauce better or worse for our health? Well, it has something good and also 
       something bad, just like everything/everyone in this universe. 

* Mushroom chicken
+ pre-soak mushroom (Don't forgot to take away the forgot to steam it. Would make difference?)
+ stir fry the chicken, just a little bit, add the soaked mushroom and the water
+ low first then change to heat level 2, watch and KEEP the water boiling SLOWLY.
+ turn off the stove when there is still a litter water, add chopped green onion and let the pan sit for a few minutes. 

Attempt 2: 
half cup water, 5 wing drum section, keep the soup boiling SLOWLY about 70 minutes: 
Something easy to forget: 
+'
 forgot to add soy sauce when stir fry(baidu suggests add soy sauce just before serve and stir fry a little. Also try light soy sauce.)
+ too much soy source, cover the taste of mushroom. 
+ connective tissue began to dissolve which has special taste(good, meet just 
about to fall apart. 
google science of slow cooking. 

Attempt 3: 
Ingredients:
+ (forget to track the water, but about half cup), 
+ 3 wing drumettes, chopped into two. 
+ Green Onions, Garlic, 

Directions:
  1. Heat olive oil on high heat, add garlic and big green onion. When the smell come out, add the drumettes and stir fry until light (brown?.)
  2. Add shiitakes mushroom and the soaked water, reduce the heat to low(about 1.5). Cover the skillet and let cook for about 50 minutes. 
  3. After 50 minutes, there should be still a little liquid left in the skillet. Raise heat to high. Add light sour sauce and salts, stir for a few second. Add fined chopped green onion and serve. 

Results: 
  1. The taste is about right and the taste of mushroom is good. The chicken might be a bit bland for some people. We could have add a bit more salt. 
  2. The drumette is not cooked long enough and the connective tissue is not softened. Next try heat 1.5 + 2 hours. 

Attempt 4:

Ingredients:
+ ~5 big Dry Shiitake mushrooms,  a few small ones, soaked in 4 cups of water. Two cups of water are absorbed in the end.  
+ 3 wing drumettes, chopped into two. 
+ Green Onions, Garlic, 

Directions:
  1. Heat olive oil on high heat, add garlic and big green onion. When the smell come out, add the drumettes and stir fry until light (brown?.)
  2. Add shiitakes mushroom and the soaked water, reduce the heat to low (level one). Cover the skillet and let cook for about () minutes. 
  3. After 50 minutes, there should be still a little liquid left in the skillet. Raise heat to high. Add light sour sauce and salts, stir for a few second. Add fined chopped green onion and serve. 

Results: 
  1. add salt and soy sauce in the end seems to be a bit bland.

* Shrimp scampi: 
Ingredients: 
+  1b shrimp
+ 2/3 tablespoon butter 
+ 2/3 teaspoon minced garlic  
+ 2/3 tbspoon lemon juicy 

Directions:
(The following instruction is from the google search "shrimp scampi")
1). unshelled and deveined the shrimp. On a plate, arrange the shrimp so they lay flat and evenly spaced. Pat the shrimp completely dry with a paper towel. (Season) the shrimp with salt and pepper. 
2). Heat the skillet (over) medium heat. When the foaming (subsides), (raise) the heat to high and invert the plate so that all shrimp fall into the pan all at once. Cook, without moving,  for 1 minute. Add garlic and cook another minute. Turn the shrimp around. Cook 2 minutes. (Transfer) the shrimp to a bowl. 
3). (Return) the pan to the heat. (Pour) (in) vermount and 2/3 tbspoon lemon juicy. Boil until the liquid become lightly thickened.  Stir the parsley into the saurce. (Pour) the sauce (over) the shrimp and serve. 

Afterthoughts: 
Since the original receipt has vermounth, but I don't. So I add way more lemon juicy and the shrimp is too sour( a big failure). 

Pitfalls: 
+ Forget to raise the heat after put the shrimp into the pan.
+ Time might not be correct. High heat for 2 minutes for the first side seems too much. Reduce the time.   
+ Step (3) might be replaced by: chop green onions into long thin stripes and put it to the shrimp, stir it a little bit and then turn off the heat and serve.40+ Some frozen shrimp is salted and might not need seasoning at all. 
* Steam Tilapia Fillets
** Ingredients: 
   + Half piece of a big Tilapia Fillets(? pound)
   + Gingers, Garlic (when minced, should be enough to cover the fillet thinly, CAUTION: Don't put too much), Green Onions. 
   + Olive Oil
** Directions: 
   + (Cut?) the Fillets horizontally half way through. Mince Garlics and gingers. Cut the Green Onions to long thin stripes. Use three spoons to form a rack in a plate, and put the fillet on the rack so that the fillet is not boiled in the liquid. Add the minced garlic and gingers to the top and fillet. Season the fillet with salt and pepper.  We can also stick the minced garlic and gingers into the cut so that the juice can be absorbed by the fillet better. Add some olive oil to the top of the fillet. 
   + Add some water to a pan(I used a 12-in pan and add two cups of water). Put a small rack in the pan to separate the water and the plate.  Bring the water to boil. Put the plate into the pan. Cover the pan and cooking (a few minutes) until the fillet is well-cooked(be careful not to override). Add the green onion stripes. Turn off the heat but leave the pan covered and sit for a few minutes. CAUTION: let the plate sit in the covered pan too long. Otherwise, the green onions will lose the green color.

** Result:
   The texture is good and not enough flavor though. But it's health, very litter oil. Still looking for a receipt which can enhance the flavor without using too much seasoning and oil.
