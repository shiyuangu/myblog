#+TITLE: Cooking: My Scientific Approach
If we google a particular dish, we usually find many different receipts. I find all receipts do something right 
(sometimes, something wrong too). I try to learn from each receipt, combine the right practice and also understand 
the science behind.  This blog is to document my success, my failure and my thinking. 
 
* Scramble Eggs with Tomatoes

What I did: 
+ Two eggs + two tomatoes 
+ whisk the eggs
+ add 1 tbsp butter to pan, preheat until butter begins to sizzle. 
+ pour the whisked eggs, let it set for 3-4 minutes, heat level on 6. 
  Turn it around, scramble, then remove to a plate. 
+ Put the tomatoes, high heat, squeeze/press the tomato 
  until the tomatoes becomes ()
+ add back the eggs, mix well the tomato and immediately remove to a plate.
  Eggs are delicate and will continue to 
Afterthoughts:
eggs are not fluffy enough. Possible causes: 
+ [[http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/scrambled-eggs-with-tomato-cheddar-and-basil.html][Williams-sonoma.com]] , we should add water to eggs which chinese cooking guide says it is a bad idea.
+ not enough egg and eggs span too thin on the pan. 
+ not whisked enough. 
+ the eggs are overcook. Maybe 1 minute is enough. 
  
* Honey baked Chicken Wing 
 I almost follow the instruction of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmlgqoUo0es][this video]] except 
that I brash with the honey at the very end and turn the oven to  
"broil" to make the skin crispy. This is a common-use of broil [fn:1]. 
This is what I did: 
+ Put the wings in a bowl, add dark soy sauce[fn:2], black pepper, salt. 
  Let the wings set for four hours (The video receipt suggests two hours).
+ preheat the oven to 380^oF, bake the wings on a baking rack for 30min, turn
  the wings around half way to bake evenly on both side. 
+ Mix 1 tbsp honey with 1/2 tbsp water, coat the wings, turn to oven to broil, 
  and broil the wings for 4-5 minutes. 
+ Cool and Serve. 

Afterthoughts:
+ The wings are crispy and the taste is just right. 
  The wings are a bit burnt 
  (which seems to be a common problem when baked with sugar. 
   All pictures online show the same problem). 
  Try reduce the broil time to 3 minutes next time. 
+ The wings was on the lower rack of the oven when broiled. 
  Cooking guides[2] suggest broiling is done close to the heat source 
  (2-5 inches from the flame(top burner). Try to place the honey-coated wings
  on the upper rack of the oven when broil next time. 
+ The step of turning around wing half way when baked may not be necessary.
  The whole idea of baking is to use the ambient hot air instead of 
  the infrared radiation. If an oven is designed properly, 
  turning the wings around half way may not be necessary. Try to cut this
  step next time.
  - Another experiment confirms this: no need to turn the wing around halfway. 
    When baked on a rack, both side are evenly cooked.

[fn:2] There are two types of soy source used in Asian cooking:  light soy sauce and 
       dark soy sauce.  Dark soy sauce is thicker, easier to stick to the material and 
       hence a better choice for baking. Dark soy source also adds nice color to a dish. According to 
       [[http://chinesefood.about.com/od/chinesefoodglossary1/g/dark-soy-sauce.htm][this]], dark soy source may contain up to 10 times anti-oxidants found in red wine, and
       has the health benefits of improving blood flow. However, dark soy sauce has a high sodium content. 
       As far as I know, study shows correlations between high sodium intake and high blood pressure. You might
       feel confused: Then is it dark soy sauce better or worse for our health? Well, it has something good and also 
       something bad, just like everything/everyone in this universe.
